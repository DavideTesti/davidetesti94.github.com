### EXPERIENCE
TikTok gmbh | Berlin, GER	            11/2020-09/2023
Quality Analyst TECH Team | Full remote
•	I was a Quality Analyst belonging to the TECH team and therefore responsible for the analysis of the operating activities of my department (TnS). 
•	Here below are some of the activities I have now expertise on: 
- Media content analysis and controlling. 
- Data management: storage and ETL pipeline 
- Big Data Analysis: users, videos, policies' implementation metrics. A/B policies testing.
- KPI metrics dashboarding and reporting 
- Trend analysis and control on the effective implementation of the community policies 
- Specific project team management
•	Spearheaded the development and implementation of a ETL pipeline for the recently launched Berlin office. This innovation reduced the team size required for weekly data analysis from 5 to 3, generating significant cost savings for the company. My efforts were recognized with a productivity bonus for the month.
•	Utilized SQL to efficiently extract data from various sources, followed by rigorous data validation and transformation using Python to ensure data quality and prepare it for analysis. This process involved implementing feature engineering techniques to create new insights. This granted to the company a lean and standardized approach to data, not single-employe-dependent. 
•	Leveraged the analyzed data to develop a comprehensive set of KPI metrics, enabling clear performance monitoring for the TnS department. Regularly created insightful dashboards and reports to keep department’ team members and stakeholders rapidly updated. From this standpoint it was then possible for the company to better address the issue affecting the German Media market.
